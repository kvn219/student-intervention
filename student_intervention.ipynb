    "A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a \"test\" on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes).

    "k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.  It is commonly used in geo-spatial research.  [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)\n",

    "Computationally expensive and requires a lot of memory\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Why should it be applied:__ Given the context of the data, i.e yearly collected school data, KNN might be a good option because we dont have to re-train the model as often and thus we can bear the computational and memory expense.  "

Given the limited resources of the school district, LR's prediction time is faster than K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and roughly similar to the Decision Tree (DT).   Which will translate to lower costs because it's less computationally expensive than KNN.  Moreover, the performance of the LR at 300 samples is the highest among the different models at .7761 (which signals that it has done better with more training samples).  And finally, LR's variance from train-to-test scores decreases as we increase the number of training points which speaks to its ability better generalize to the testing data when we add more data points."
